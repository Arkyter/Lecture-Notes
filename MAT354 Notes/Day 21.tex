A continuous, real-valued function $u(z)$ on a region $\Omega \subset \CC$ is said to satisfy the mean value property
\[ u(z_0) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} u(z_0 + re^{i\theta}) \, d\theta \]
when the disc $\abs{z - z_0} \leq r$ is contained in $\Omega$. It was previously shown on problem set 2 that harmonic functions satisfy the mean value property. Recall, that the problem stated that harmonic functions satisfy the mean value property, and that harmonic functions also satisfy the max/min principle.
\begin{theorem}
    Any continuous real-valued function $u(z)$ on a region $\Omega$ which satisfies the mean value property is harmonic.
\end{theorem}
