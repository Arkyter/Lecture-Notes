Lecture notes from my classes at UofT; will be updated daily (hopefully).

**Hyperlinks are disabled on Github PDFs...?** Download the raw file to get access to links, I guess. Oopsies.

Current list of classes:
- MAT257 (Analysis II)
- MAT327 (Intro to Topology)
- MAT377 (Probability Theory)
- MAT482 (Composition Laws, Rings of Low Rank, and Related Counting Problems; tl;dr, arithmetic statistics stuff)

Errata list (?):
- Empty for now!
