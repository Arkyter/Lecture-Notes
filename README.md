# lecture-notes
Lecture notes from my classes at UofT; will be updated daily (hopefully).

**IMPORTANT! i will catch up on 347/367 notes over reading week**

**Disclaimer:** This is updated as often as I want... which is most likely daily, unless I get bored or something. If a day is missing, or if some details are wrong, message me (@arkyter on Discord) so I can fix them :3

Current list of classes:
- MAT347 (Algebra)
- MAT351 (Partial Differential Equations) -- maintained by [@evlasics](https://github.com/evlasics)
- MAT357 (Intro to Real Analysis) -- since Landon (prof) uploads notes, I will write the compilation later on in the course instead (since there is no point in scribin daily atp yea?)
- MAT367 (Differential Geometry)
- MAT425 (Differential Topology) -- maintained by [@evlasics](https://github.com/evlasics)
- MAT454 (Adv. Complex Analysis) -- also supposedly kept by the prof, but we'll see

Audit list (notes may be kept, but sparsely):
- None this semester (so far) :3c

**Archived classes!**

> Fall 2024
- MAT327 (Intro to Topology); textbook link [here](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~dkosanovic/24-FS/Munkres-Topology.pdf)
- MAT363 (Geometry of Curves and Surfaces); I dropped this class because I didn't like it :c
- MAT377 (Probability Theory); class follows the [textbook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Rpkr-NCEyqygvypR65RznaZkb36KHB29/view?pli=1) closely, so I won't record notes for some days. Each class goes over about 1 subsection in the book.
- MAT482 (Composition Laws, Rings of Low Rank, and Related Counting Problems; tl;dr, arithmetic statistics stuff); class has notes taken by professor, so I won't be keeping notes for this as often.
- MAT1304 (Extremal Combinatorics); ended up not keeping notes for this.

> Winter 2025
- MAT257 (Analysis II) - complete set done.
- MAT267 (Advanced ODEs) - yea no. i can't read anything on the board sorry
- APM461 (Combinatorial Methods) - ankle fracture so i can't commute to this class unfortunately

> Fall 2026
- MAT417 (Analytic NT) - stopped going
- MAT436 (Linear Operators) - nothing that really can be written from class...
- MAT354 (Complex Analysis)

> Winter 2026

**Todo List**:
- Rework style files system (like, 75% done or whatev...)? but i want the spacing to be nice... without having to write \\[8pt] and \noindent. fmlllll ~w~

Errata list (?):
- none so far wawawawa
