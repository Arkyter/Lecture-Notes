# lecture-notes
Lecture notes from my classes at UofT; will be updated daily (hopefully).

**Disclaimer:** This is updated as often as I want... which is most likely daily, unless I burn out or something. If a day is missing, or if some details are wrong, message me (@arkyter on Discord) so I can fix them :3

This also means I will revise / change some details from class if I think it helps make the notes clearer / fix mistakes from lecture.

**Hyperlinks are disabled on Github PDFs...?** Download the raw file to get access to links, I guess. Oopsies.

Current list of classes:
- MAT257 (Analysis II)
- MAT327 (Intro to Topology)
- MAT377 (Probability Theory)
- MAT482 (Composition Laws, Rings of Low Rank, and Related Counting Problems; tl;dr, arithmetic statistics stuff)

Audit list (notes may be kept, but sparsely):
- MAT1304 (Extremal Combinatorics)

Errata list (?):
- Empty for now!
