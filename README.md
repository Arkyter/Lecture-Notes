# lecture-notes
Lecture notes from my classes at UofT; will be updated daily (hopefully).

**Disclaimer:** This is updated as often as I want... which is most likely daily, unless I burn out or something. If a day is missing, or if some details are wrong, message me (@arkyter on Discord) so I can fix them :3

This also means I will revise / change some details from class if I think it helps make the notes clearer / fix mistakes from lecture.

**Hyperlinks are disabled on Github PDFs...?** Download the raw file to get access to links, I guess. Oopsies.

Current list of classes:
- MAT257 (Analysis II)
- MAT267 (Advanced ODEs)
- MAT363 (Geometry of Curves and Surfaces)
- APM461 (Combinatorial Methods)

Audit list (notes may be kept, but sparsely):
- None this semester (so far) :3c

Archived class list!
- MAT327 (Intro to Topology); textbook link [here](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~dkosanovic/24-FS/Munkres-Topology.pdf)
- MAT377 (Probability Theory); class follows the [textbook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Rpkr-NCEyqygvypR65RznaZkb36KHB29/view?pli=1) closely, so I won't record notes for some days. Each class goes over about 1 subsection in the book.
- MAT482 (Composition Laws, Rings of Low Rank, and Related Counting Problems; tl;dr, arithmetic statistics stuff); class has notes taken by professor, so I won't be keeping notes for this as often.
- MAT1304 (Extremal Combinatorics); ended up not keeping notes for this.

**Todo List**:
- Rework style files system (like, 10% done or whatev...)
- smth smth tutorial answers? idk if i *want* to do it tho hmm.
- day 4-6 of 267, day 2-3 of apm461, day 5-7 of 363

Errata list (?):
- Empty for now!
