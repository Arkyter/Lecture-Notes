# lecture-notes
Lecture notes from my classes at UofT; will be updated daily (hopefully).

**Disclaimer:** This is updated as often as I want... which is most likely daily, unless I burn out or something. If a day is missing, or if some details are wrong, message me (@arkyter on Discord) so I can fix them :3

This also means I will revise / change some details from class if I think it helps make the notes clearer / fix mistakes from lecture.

**Hyperlinks are disabled on Github PDFs...?** Download the raw file to get access to links, I guess. Oopsies.

Current list of classes:
- MAT257 (Analysis II)
- MAT327 (Intro to Topology); textbook link [here](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~dkosanovic/24-FS/Munkres-Topology.pdf)
- MAT377 (Probability Theory); class follows the [textbook](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Rpkr-NCEyqygvypR65RznaZkb36KHB29/view?pli=1) closely, so I won't record notes for some days. Each class goes over about 1 subsection in the book.
- MAT482 (Composition Laws, Rings of Low Rank, and Related Counting Problems; tl;dr, arithmetic statistics stuff); class has notes taken by professor, so I won't be keeping notes for this as often.

Audit list (notes may be kept, but sparsely):
- MAT1304 (Extremal Combinatorics)

**Todo List**:
- Rework style files system (like, 10% done or whatev...)

Errata list (?):
- Empty for now!
