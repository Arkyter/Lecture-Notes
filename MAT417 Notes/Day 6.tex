\section{Day 6: (Sep. 18, 2025)}
Our plan for today is to finish the proof that $L(\chi, 1) \neq 0$ for all $\chi \neq 1$, and find an example of explicit number theoretic applications. This example will require the law of quadratic reciprocity, which we wlil discuss (in chapter 1 of Serre's book).
