\section{Day 38: Partition of Unity (Jan. 8, 2025)}
Consider the bump function; given $C \subset U \subset \RR^n$, with $C$ compact and $U$ open, there is a $\SC^\infty$ function $f : U \to \RR$ such that $0 \leq f \leq 1$, $f(x) = 1$ for $x \in C$, and $f(x) = 0$ for $x$ outside some compact subset of $U$.
