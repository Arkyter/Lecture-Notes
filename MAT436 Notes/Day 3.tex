We return to listen to our dear preacher for another hour. Here is a list of professor priest's quotes from today:

Given a Banach space and a closed subspace, there exists a complement. This is topologically equivalent to a Hilbert space (to the Hilbert space norm). 
\\[8pt]
Every Hilbert space has an orthonormal basis.

There is a paper by J. Hogan and S. Li.
\begin{exercise}
    Linear transformations induce a new inner product.

\begin{exercise}
    We know that a unit circle in $\RR^2$ centered about the origin is induced by some norm, and there are infinitely many automorphisms on $\RR^2$ sending $D^1$ to itself. An ellipse centered about the origin in $\RR^2$ is likewise induced by some norm; can you find an example of a function sending the ellipse back to itself, and show that there are infinitely many such functions?
