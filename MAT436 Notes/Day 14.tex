\begin{exercise}
    Show that a Hilbert space with an uncountable orthonormal basis does not admit a countable dense subset (i.e., not separable).
\end{exercise}
\noindent Wrap an $\eps$-ball about each element of the basis, and observe that any countable set cannot intersect each of these balls per uncountability. Thus, countable sets cannot be dense in such a Hilbert space.
\begin{exercise}
    Take two invertible positive operators, which commute, (you may take one of them to be the identity, and the other self adjoint and positive and invertible). Look at the weighted average (perhaps start with the normal average); show that it is invertible.
