\section{Day 1: Inaudible Lecture (Sep. 3, 2025)}
Attendance won't be taken every lecture. This class is glorified linear algebra. Otherwise, incomprehensible lecture (professor speaks quieter than the air conditioner). This class is truly a test if you have tinnitus or not.

Throughout this class, we will use $H$ to refer to a Hilbert space, $U$ a unitary operator (where $U^\ast = U^{-1}$), and $T \in B(H)$ a bounded operator on $H$. In particular, we have that $(UTU^{-1})^\ast = UT^\ast U^{-1}$.

Exercise from class. Let $S \subseteq H$. If $S$ is a closed linear subspace, show that $S^{\perp \perp} = S$ and that $S$ admits an orthogonal complement. Is this a sufficient and necessary condition?
