A compact operator sends the unit ball to a compact set (or precompact, I guess). In particular, a compact operator sends an orthonormal basis to a sequence converging to $0$ in norm.

Tutorial stuff. If $X, Y$ are Banach spaces, then an operator $T : X \to Y$ is compact if $T(\ol{B^\ast_1})$ is compact in $Y$.
\begin{theorem}
    If $X$ and $Y$ are Hilbert spaces, then $T$ is compct if and only if there exists a sequence $T_n : X \to Y$ with $\rank T_n < \infty$ and $T_n \to T$ in $\norm{\cdot}_{\mathrm{op}}$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{fact}
    If $S$ is compact, then $ST$ and $TS$ are compact for any other operator $T$, i.e., the compact operator $K$ forms a two-sided ideal in $B(X)$.
\end{fact}
\begin{fact}
    The compact operators $K$ are closed.
\end{fact}
\begin{definition}
    We say $B(H)/K(H) = Q(H)$ is a Calkin algebra.
\end{definition}
\begin{theorem}[Atkinson]
    $\Fred(H) = \GL(Q(H))$, where $\Fred(H)$ denotes the operators with index on $H$.
\end{theorem}
\noindent In particular, the Calkin short exact sequence is given by
\[ 0 \to K \to B(H) \to Q(H) \to 0 \]
of $C^\ast$ algebras. The unilateral shift $S \in B(\ell^2(\NN))$ is a $C^\ast$ algebra generated by $S$, and $C^\ast(S)$ is defined as the smallest $C^\ast$ algebra of $B(\ell^2(\NN))$ containing $S$. In particular, $C^\ast(S)$ contains all $P(S, S^\ast)$ for $p \in \CC[z, \ol z]$; for example, $S$, $S^\ast$, $1 - S^\ast S$, and $1$ dimensional projections $e_{ij} = (S^\ast)^j (1 - SS^\ast) S^i$. We call $C^\ast(S)$ a \textit{Toeplitz} algebra. The Toeplitz short exact sequence is given by
\[ 0 \to K \to C^\ast(S) \to \frac{C^\ast(S)}{K} \to 0. \]
We may write $\ell^2(\NN) = \{(a_n) \in \ell^2(\ZZ) \mid a_n = 0 \text{ if } n \geq 0\}$, and consider
\[ \ell^2(\NN) \subset \ell^2(\ZZ) \to L^2(S^1) \]
by the Fourier transform by $(e_n^j = \delta_{nj}) \mapsto z^j$, where we are sending $(\dots, 0, 1, 0, \dots)$ with a $1$ in the $j$th position to $z^j$.
\begin{definition}
    $H^2 = \{f : \ol \DD \to \CC \mid f \text{ is holomorphic on } \mathrm{int}(\DD)\}$ is called a Hardy space, where $\ol \DD$ is the closed unit disc in $\CC$.
\end{definition}
\noindent In this manner, any element of $H^2$ may be considered to map
\[ \sum_{j=0}^\infty a_jz^j \mapsto \sum_{y=0}^\infty a_j z^{j+1} = z \sum_{j=0}^\infty a_j z^j \]
under $S$, and $C^\ast(S)$ embeds into $B(H^2)$ by $S \mapsto M_z$, $S^j \mapsto M_{z^j}$, $p(S) \mapsto M_{p(z)}$, where $M_f(g) = fg$ and $\norm{M_f} = \norm{f}_\infty$. This means that the image of $C^\ast(S) \injto B(H^2)$ contains $M_p$, $p \in C(S^1)$.
