    \noindent This class is \textit{MAT327}; $3$ meaning third year, $2$ meaning the contents are on the fundamental side, and $7$ meaning no mercy.

Course administration matters first;
\begin{itemize}
    \item The course link is given \href{https://drorbn.net/24-327}{here} (this will link straight to Quercus).
    \item The textbook is \href{https://www.pearson.com/en-ca/subject-catalog/p/topology-classic-version/P200000006299/9780137848669}{James Munkres' Topology} (online PDF: \href{https://people.math.ethz.ch/~dkosanovic/24-FS/Munkres-Topology.pdf}{ETH Zurich mirror}); Prof Bar-Natan strongly recommends a paper copy, though (since people get distracted on the computer).
\end{itemize}

\noindent Today's reading in the textbook is on Ch. 1, sections 1 to 8, and Ch. 2, sections 12 to 13. Readings are supplementary to lecture material\footnote{iirc it won't be tested unless specified. its still good to learn tho}. The goal of this course is to understand continuity in its most general form; in particular,
\begin{itemize}
    \item In MAT157, we studied continuity in $f : \RR \to \RR$;
    \item In MAT257, we will study continuity in $f : \RR^n \to \RR^m$;
\end{itemize} 
but in this class, we will study continuity in $F : X \to Y$, where $X, Y$ are arbitrary spaces, such as (but not limited to) $\RR^n$, $\RR^\NN$, $\{0, 1\}^\NN$ (binary sequences), and so on.
